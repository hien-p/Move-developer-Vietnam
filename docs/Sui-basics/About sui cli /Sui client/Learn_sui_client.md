# Learn how to build on Sui Client Command Line!

According to the [Sui CLI docs](https://arc.net/l/quote/eurnfqpe):

> The Sui CLI client command provides command-level access to interact with the Sui network. Typical uses for sui client include publishing Move smart contracts, retrieving object information, executing transactions, or managing addresses.


# Check Sui Version
:::::info[Parent]
Make sure you have install [the Sui version](/docs/Sui-basics/Set%20up%20/How%20to%20set%20up%20Sui.mdx) 
::::tip[Child]
To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:
```Bash
sui --version 
# or 
sui -V
```
If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.
