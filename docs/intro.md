This document will help you understand Sui technology. It is designed to optimize your learning journey in web3. It will help you integrate the knowledge acquired from the OpenEdu101's SUI bootcamp program, and delve deeper into the contents of these documents. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of how to build smart contracts and create web3 projects.

I've divided the content into two parts to make it easier to understand. The first part, 'sui-basic', teaches you the basics. The second part, 'sui-advanced', covers more complex ideas and uses of sui technology.
