Pilotfish is a new Sui validator node architecture that enables horizontal elastic scaling. To understand what this means, it's important to understand what a validator even does. There are two ways to interact with a blockchain – read and write. Anyone can read the blockchain, but only validators can write (add a new block) to the blockchain. In order to write a block to a blockchain, validators must come together to decide what to include in the block – this process is known as "consensus".
